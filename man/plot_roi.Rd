\usage{
plot_roi(MigrObj, idx, spots.slot = "raw")

%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{MigrObj}{
    A MigrObject as generated by \link{\code{import_XML}},
  }
  \item{idx}{
    A subset of cells to plot, with the same meaning as \link{\code{"["}},
    so this can be left out to plot all cells
    or a numeric of which cells to plot, e.g. \code{1:3} to plot the
    first three,
    or \code{c(TRUE,FALSE)} to plot every odd cell.
  }
}
\item{spots.slot}{
  {Spots slot data,as in dat.slot in \link{\code{clustering}}, currently should be left unchanged}
%%     ~~Describe \code{spots.slot} here~~
}
}
\details{
    Each cell will be called with a new plot, so you want to put
    everything in the same output 
%%  ~~ If necessary, more details than the description above ~~
}
\value{
  Undefined, as this function is to be called for its side effect of creating plots.
